## Project 1: Sales Data Analysis

### Description
This project involves analyzing sales data to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and regional performance. The insights help in strategic decision-making for businesses.

### Key Components
- Data Aggregation: Grouping data by regions, months, and products.
- Visualizations: Line charts, bar plots, and heatmaps to represent findings.
- Insights: Seasonal trends and top-performing regions/products.

### What I Learned
- How to clean and preprocess sales data for analysis.
- The role of visualizations in communicating data insights effectively.
- Techniques to identify and interpret seasonal patterns in business data.

## Project 2: Weather Data Visualization

### Description
This project visualizes weather data to analyze temperature, rainfall, and humidity trends over time. The data is cleaned and explored for patterns and anomalies.

### Key Components
- Data Cleaning: Replacing invalid/missing values with statistical methods.
- Visualization: Heatmaps, line charts, and correlation matrices.
- Anomaly Detection: Identifying extreme weather events.

### What I Learned
- Advanced visualization techniques for representing time-series data.
- How to detect anomalies and interpret their impact on trends.
- Correlations between weather parameters like temperature and rainfall.

## Project 3: Predicting House Prices

### Description
This project predicts house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset is cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed to identify key features influencing prices. A regression model is trained to estimate prices accurately.

### Key Components
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Model Training: Using algorithms like Linear Regression and Random Forest.
- Performance Metrics: Evaluated with RMSE and RÂ² Score.

### What I Learned
- The importance of feature engineering in improving model performance.
- How to interpret model evaluation metrics to assess accuracy.
- Insights into how features like location and area impact house prices.
